# Project 03-Juicy-Brick-Breaker
This is a project for MSCH-220, October 10th 2020. 
 
This project was designed to allow us to practice adding cool features into a brick breaking game. Features include adding music and images that we have created in a seperate software system. It also allowed us to learn how to build a brick breaking game from scratch.

## Implementation
Changing the color of the paddle, ball, and blocks
Animate how the blocks and the paddle appear on the screen
Squeeze and stretch the paddle
Animate the size of the ball when it hits something
Animate the color of the ball after it hits something
Shake the blocks or the paddle when the ball hits something
Add sound effects
Add music
Break the blocks when they are hit
Add a background to the game
